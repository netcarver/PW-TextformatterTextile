ProcessWire Textile Textformatter module for ProcessWire 2.2+


To install, copy these files (including subdirs) into /site/modules/TextformatterTextile/.

There are three formatters supplied by this module...

TextformatterTextile
--------------------

This provides a textile formatter for multiple paragraph fields from trusted input (such as fields filled in by your
site owner.) It provides full textile support including links, lists, tables, spans, glyphs, footnotes etc.


TextformatterTextileField
-------------------------

This provides a really lightweight text formatter for single line fields from trusted sources. It only provides span
and glyph parsing.


TextformatterTextileRestricted
------------------------------

Should be used for fields that come from untrusted sources (such as site visitors.)
